          Hi there! I&apos;m Kamrul Hasan, a passionate Full Stack Developer
          currently immersed in self-directed learning and personal projects to
          sharpen my skills. My journey in web development began with a
          deep-seated fascination for crafting interactive and intuitive user
          interfaces that enhance digital experiences. I find great joy in
          exploring cutting-edge technologies and frameworks, constantly seeking
          to innovate and elevate my development capabilities. While I&apos;m in
          the early stages of my professional career, my dedication to
          continuous learning drives me to actively pursue opportunities where I
          can apply my expertise and gain valuable hands-on experience in
          building impactful web applications.
